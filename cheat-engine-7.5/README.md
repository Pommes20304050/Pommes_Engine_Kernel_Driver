# Pommes_Engine_Kernel_Driver

Personal fork of Cheat Engine 7.5 with full source-level rebranding (names, strings, binaries, resources).
Includes a custom kernel driver written from scratch using MSVC/WDK.
Compatible with major anti-cheat systems (e.g., Easy Anti-Cheat, BattlEye). In some cases (e.g., League of Legends), the kernel driver is not necessary.


# 🍟 Pommes Engine

> A fully rebranded and rebuilt fork of **Cheat Engine 7.5** — every name, string, binary, driver, icon, and resource has been renamed.  
> Based on the official [Cheat Engine 7.5](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine) source release by Dark Byte.

## 🔁 Complete Rebrand

Every single reference to `Cheat Engine`, `cheatengine`, `DBK`, and `CE` has been replaced throughout the entire codebase and all compiled outputs:

- All **Pascal source files** (`.pas`, `.lpr`, `.lpi`, `.lfm`) — renamed via automated script
- All **compiled binaries** (`.exe`, `.sys`, `.dll`) — strings patched directly in **HxD** in two passes: ANSI encoding and UTF-16 Little Endian (Unicode), since Windows stores strings in both formats
- All **locale/translation files** (`.pot`) — regenerated under the new name
- All **driver files** (`.sys`, `.inf`, `.cer`, `.pdb`) — renamed and recompiled
- All **icons and resources** (`.ico`, `.png`, `.res`) — replaced with new assets
- **Project files** (`.lpi`, `.lps`, `.lpr`, `.res`) — rebuilt under the new project name

The result: no file, string, window title, service name, registry key, or resource in the entire build contains the original Cheat Engine name.

## 📋 Overview

Pommes Engine is a full rename and rebuild of Cheat Engine 7.5. Every internal name, string, binary, kernel driver, icon, and locale file has been changed from `cheatengine` / `DBK` to `pommesengine` / `pommes`. The kernel driver was rewritten and recompiled from scratch using Visual Studio, and the final executable was processed through VMProtect.

This project is intended for personal use and local testing only.

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### 1. Source Code — Lazarus / Free Pascal

The main application is written in **Free Pascal** and built with the **Lazarus IDE**.

- All Lazarus project files (`.lpi`, `.lpr`, `.lps`) were edited — the project name, output binary name, and internal identifiers were changed from `cheatengine` to `pommesengine`
- The Pascal source file `DBK32functions.pas` was modified to reflect the new driver name (`pommes64`)
- `.pot` locale/translation files were regenerated under the new name

### 2. String Replacement — Script + HxD Hex Editor

Renaming strings happened at **two levels**:

**a) Source level (automated script)**  
A find & replace script was run across all `.pas`, `.lpi`, `.lpr`, `.lfm` source files to swap every occurrence of `CheatEngine`, `cheatengine`, `DBK`, `CE` with the new names.

**b) Binary level (HxD Hex Editor)**  
Strings embedded inside compiled binaries (`.exe`, `.sys`, `.dll`) were edited directly in **HxD** in two encoding passes:

| Pass | Encoding | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 1st | **ANSI / Editor encoding** | For narrow-char strings stored as single-byte sequences |
| 2nd | **UTF-16 Little Endian (Unicode)** | For wide-char strings used by Windows APIs and the driver |

Windows stores many internal strings (service names, device names, registry keys) as UTF-16 LE wide strings — both passes are necessary to catch everything.

### 3. Kernel Driver — Self-Written & Recompiled from Scratch

The kernel driver was not simply renamed — it was **rewritten and compiled independently**:

- **Language**: C + inline ASM (`DBKKernel/` source directory)
- **Toolchain**: Microsoft Visual Studio / MSVC + Windows Driver Kit (WDK)
- **Project file**: `DBKKernel.vcxproj` — updated with new driver name and output targets
- **Output**: `pommes64.sys` (91,032 bytes) — a 64-bit Windows kernel driver
- **Build config**: `x64/Releasewithoutsig` — built without a Microsoft-issued code signing certificate
- All intermediate artifacts freshly generated: `apic.obj`, `DBKDrvr.obj`, `DBKFunc.obj`, `memscan.obj`, `debugger.obj`, `ultimap.obj`, `vmxhelper.obj`, and more
- Driver `.inf` files updated with new service name, device name, and driver filename
- A new self-signed certificate `pommes64.cer` (776 bytes) was generated for the driver
- PDB debug symbols `pommes64.pdb` (1.1 MB) included for the driver

> ⚠️ **Note on driver signing:** Windows 64-bit requires kernel drivers to be signed.  
> For local development and testing without a paid EV certificate, use **Test Signing Mode**:
> ```
> bcdedit /set testsigning on
> ```
> Then reboot. This allows loading self-signed drivers locally without disabling Secure Boot.  
> This is the official Microsoft-supported workflow for driver development.

### 4. VMProtect Packing

After compilation, the main executable was run through **VMProtect**.

#### What VMProtect does

VMProtect is a software protection tool that transforms compiled code to make it significantly harder to reverse engineer:

- **Virtualization** — Selected code sections are converted into custom virtual machine bytecode. Instead of running native x86-64 instructions, the code runs inside an embedded VM interpreter with its own unique instruction set, different per build.
- **Mutation** — Code is rewritten into functionally equivalent but structurally different sequences, breaking pattern-based static analysis.
- **Packing & compression** — The final binary is compressed and unpacks itself at runtime, which is why the `.vmp.exe` files (~6.7 MB) are significantly smaller than the originals (~16.8 MB).
- **Anti-debug / Anti-dump** — The protected build includes checks that detect debuggers, memory dumpers, and analysis tools at runtime.

The clean unprotected build is preserved alongside the packed version for debugging purposes.

| File | Size | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `pommesengine-x86_64.exe` | ~16.8 MB | Clean compiled build |
| `pommesengine-x86_64.exe.bak` | ~16.8 MB | Backup before packing |
| `pommesengine-x86_64.vmp.exe` | ~6.7 MB | VMProtect-packed output |
| `pommesengine-x86_64-SSE4-AVX2.exe` | ~16.8 MB | AVX2-optimized variant |
| `pommesengine-x86_64-SSE4-AVX2.vmp.exe` | ~6.7 MB | AVX2 + VMProtect |

Debug symbols (`.dbg`, ~148 MB) were preserved alongside the builds.

### 5. Icons & Assets

- `cheatengine.ico` → `pommes_engine.ico` + `pommes_engine_128.ico`
- PNG variants (`pommes_engine.png`, `pommes_engine_128.png`) added
- `.res` resource file recompiled with new icon

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) + Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)
- Visual Studio 2019+ with Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for the kernel driver
- VMProtect (optional, for packing)

### Build Steps

```bash
# 1. Open cheatengine.lpi in Lazarus IDE
# 2. Build → Build All

# For the kernel driver (Visual Studio):
# Open DBKKernel/DBKKernel.sln
# Select x64 / Releasewithoutsig
# Build Solution

# To load the driver locally (Test Signing Mode):
bcdedit /set testsigning on
# Reboot, then install via the .inf file
```

## How to Load a Custom Kernel Driver

To load a custom-written driver on Windows 11 with Secure Boot enabled, you normally need Microsoft's approval (WHQL signing). To bypass DSE (Driver Signature Enforcement) during development/testing, you can use the following tool before booting into Windows:

- **Tool:** [EfiGuard by Mattiwatti](https://github.com/Mattiwatti/EfiGuard)

### What EfiDSEFix Does

| Command              | Effect                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `EfiDSEFix.exe -d`   | **Disables** DSE — Windows stops verifying driver signatures           |
| `EfiDSEFix.exe -e`   | **Re-enables** DSE — Windows enforces driver signature verification again |

> Both changes apply to the **current boot session only**. After a reboot, DSE is active again.

### Setup

After setting up EfiGuard correctly, you should see a screen with green text during boot — this confirms it is working.

### Usage (CMD as Administrator)

1. Navigate to the EfiGuard directory:
```cmd
   cd C:\Users\<YourUser>\Downloads\EfiGuard-v1.4\EfiGuard-v1.4\
```

2. **Disable** Driver Signature Enforcement:
```cmd
   EfiDSEFix.exe -d
```

3. Load your custom driver.

4. **Re-enable** Driver Signature Enforcement:
```cmd
   EfiDSEFix.exe -e
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** This method is intended for development and testing purposes only.
> Do not use on production systems. DSE exists to protect system integrity.
